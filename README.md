# HappyChickenYear
My first program in 2017 Lunar New Year.  
Since it's a Chicken Year, [Chicken](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Chicken) must be the best language to program in.  
This program simply outputs "Happy New Year!".  
And with the artistic [chicken.js](http://torso.me/chicken.js)(somehow too artistic) the creator of the language provided, I've written a simple wrapper called ChickenWrapper.  
It sounds delicious.

## Run
You have to have [node](https://nodejs.org) installed.  
Simply run:
```
node ChickenWrapper.js HappyNewYear.chicken
```
in your terminal and you will see the result.

Note: It only prints out 'Happy New Year!' not 'Happy Chicken Year!' or 'Happy Lunar New Year!' or something else longer simply because they are too long, and I'm tired of dealing with fucking long strings in Chicken.
